This repository is a list of links to and files from my previous projects on AI/Machine Learning

## [Number Reader](https://github.com/EgeEken/Number-Reader)
An AI program that can be trained to read numbers on a 16x16 black and white image.

Weights and biases for a 2 layer neural network model and a 3 layer deep neural network model with up to 83% accuracy are in the linked page, as well as a training dataset of 1000 labeled images + 200 for testing
